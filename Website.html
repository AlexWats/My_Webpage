        <h2>Hard Disk Drives</h2>
        <p>A hard disk drive (or HDD) is a storage device found in computers that uses a disk to store files.
        It works like an old phonograph: A needle selects the strip of data that is needed at any given time.
        But there is only one needle, so it can only do so much at one time.</p>
