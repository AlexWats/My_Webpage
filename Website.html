        <h1>Hard disk drives, solid state drives, and other storage devices.</h1>
        <h2>Hard Disk Drives</h2>
        <p>A hard disk drive (or HDD) is a storage device found in computers that uses a disk and a needle to store files.
        It works like an old phonograph: The needle selects the strip of data that is needed at any given time.
        But there is only one needle, so it can only do so much at one time. It also requires less processing power than a SSD (see below)</p>
        <h2>Solid State Drives</h2>
        <p>A solid state drive (or SSD) is a storage device found in computers that uses non-moving parts to select strips of data. 
        Since nothing inside of it moves, it can select strips of data almost instantaniously. It can even select multiple strips at the same time,
        which most often results in faster loading times. But as this type of storage device has such a high preformance rate, it requires more RAM (random access memory) to work properly, which can slow the loading time down to less than that of a HDD if a large amount of data is being loaded at once.</p>
