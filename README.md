# Things I have learned.
I learned that there are many things that I don't already know about computers. But I am confident that by the time this semester is over, I will have learned many things about computers that I don't already know at this time.

# Things I have yet to learn.
I still have yet to learn about creating a video game. I need to learn about JavaScript and C++ in order to properly create a video game.
